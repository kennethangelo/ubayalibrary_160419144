        "content" => "It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.
    The first is to reflect on why you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at King’s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. ‘Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,’ he says.
    There’s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading others’ emotions and have greater moral sensitivity, possibly due to their simulation of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive ‘reserve building’ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimer’s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when you’re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.",

        "content" => "We read a lot of books in our family. We have books all over our house, in almost every room of our house. And each week, I check out what feels like a ton of books from the library. That puts even more books in our house.
    Reading good books is a big part of our homeschool. Books are just a part of our lives. And that's how we want it for our family. My husband and I each brought a library of our own books into our marriage.
    Over the years we have had to let go of many of those books to make room for children's books. We only have so much room for books in our home. We try to reserve that space for books that we know our family is going to love reading over and over again - or books we will want to reference from time to time - or books that we will want to pass onto others when we have outgrown or finished with them - or books we want to savor and take notes in the margins.
    But there are just so many good books we want to read! So we take full advantage of our library. Today I'm sharing some tips I've learned for using the library successfully.
    Find a 'home' for your library materials
    We have locations all around our house where things 'belong' and we call that their 'homes.' It helps my family know where to put things when we are tidying up. If we come across something that we don't know where it lives in our home, we need to discuss if it's something we really need or do we need to identify a home for it. Using this approach with our library materials has helped tremendously.
    We have a wooden crate in our homeschool room and that's where our library materials live.
    We take the books out and read or listen to them. My kids take them to their rooms. They take them in the car. But they know, through continued training I might add, that when they are done with them, library books get returned to the library box in the schoolroom. I admit, this is not something we have completely mastered.
    We do misplace a book now and then. But when I look at the volume of books we have checked out of the library, I am okay with this.
    Since the beginning of the school year, we have checked out close to 400 items from our library.
    We have misplaced three during that time. One we eventually found. One we decided to replace because we just couldn't find it anywhere. The other one we are still looking for and hoping it will turn up soon.
    Our library is allowing us to continue checking out this misplaced book unless someone else puts it on hold because they know we are looking for it. This means we are not racking up late fees on it. We will replace it soon if we cannot find it. 
    But knowing that we have kept up with almost 400 library items this school year alone, I am good with having to pay for a couple of lost books if it comes to that. 
    Schedule recurring trips to the library
    Okay. This tip was a game changer for me.
    Our schedule for going to the library used to be quite random. And that led to us racking up a lot of late fees. Because we weren't sticking to any specific schedule, we were sometimes hitting and mostly missing on getting books back on time. I hate to admit it, but our late fees were once over $50!
    That hurt, that really hurt! After that, we quit going to the library for a while. 
    Now we go to the library once a week. We always go on the same day of the week. We go on Mondays because we are already close to the library on Mondays, at my daughter's dance class following our Essentials class. This makes it easy for a trip to the library to be included in our weekly schedule. 
    This means all of our books are due back on Mondays. This is huge for us! No more having books due back all throughout the week. Have you ever just returned from the library only to find you had another book due back in a couple of days? Not that our library is all that far from our house, but if returning books on time becomes a burden on our schedule, we won't go. 
    So I suggest that if you have had trouble with owing late fees at the library, like I have, that you try choosing a recurring schedule for going to the library that works for your family and see if that helps.",

        "content" => "If your library is like most libraries, then you probably do a really great job of doing internal marketing but are less successful at external marketing. Your stuck inside the library and need to find a way to take your message out into the community. This has been one of the greatest challenges for most libraries I know, except for the big ones that have dedicated staff and budgets. Getting outside of the library and raising your public profile can really help your local community get to know and understand what the library is and the value it adds to your local community. So let’s do outreach!
    Summer is an intense time of outreach for me as the town I work in hosts a monthly event called First Fridays. The First Friday of every month from May through October, I take my set up and go downtown and help promote the library. Over the years, I have perfected the set up and want to share some tips with you. This has been a very successful source of marketing for our library, though it hasn’t always been without a few bumps in the road.
    Over time, we have perfected our basic outreach scenario and we have put together a planning checklist to help us make sure that we have all of our items packed up and ready to go before we head out the door. A majority of the items I actually keep packaged together in my office, like our table coverings and signage. But I’ll have to go to another part of the library to get our tables and chairs because they aren’t stored in my office. My checklist includes a listing of the concrete items we’ll need, including a reminder to take water for staff. Staying hydrated is important. It also includes space for us to write in items we may need based on what activity we are doing. Looking at the planning checklist a couple of days before the event helps me make sure that I have every thing I need the day off and eliminates some of the stress and worry that can come with an outreach event.
    I do have to say that recently I saw several libraries had done storytimes at local Pride events and I loved this idea. I don’t do a lot of storytimes because my target audience is teens, but I think it would be cool to have storytimes at outreach events. Because First Fridays is a music and arts festival there is always a band playing music, so storytimes may not be right for this event, but I think libraries should definitely consider adding them to outreach events if they work for the event.
    Each time we do an outreach event, we have new people come into the Teen MakerSpace. If you aren’t already doing outreach events, I highly suggest that you consider it because it is a powerful marketing tool.",

        "content" => "Having to cite your sources may seem like a boring step in the writing process. It’s often tempting to avoid the task till the eleventh hour and end up in a hopeless rush to prepare a mistake-riddled list of citations at the end.
    Save yourself the stress with these handy citation tips that can take your research paper to the next level.
    1. Follow Your Style Guide
    A style guide is a set of standards for writing and formatting a document. You’ll need one when you take up writing a research paper. Make sure you know which style guide you should use for your paper. Different styles follow their unique set of rules for formatting, in-text citations, and how to list reference entries.
    Some of the most commonly used style guides used by academics are MLA (Modern Language Association), APA (American Psychological Association), and CMOS (Chicago Manual of Style).
    2. …and Be Consistent With It
    Your style guide is usually determined by an instructor or faculty members of your department. Sometimes you may have to roll with different styles for different classes. 
    Whichever style you follow, make sure it’s consistent throughout the project. Double-check your citations at the end of your essay to ensure any last-minute improvements that may be needed before you turn in your work.
    3. Be Careful With Period Placements
    It’s strange to think that one misplaced period (.) could wreak havoc on your research paper — but welcome to the world of academia! Pay careful attention to where you’re placing your full stops and make sure they’re in line with the citation style you’re using. 
    For the majority of style guides, like APA and MLA, the period is almost always placed outside and after the parentheses (brackets). You can remember this by reminding yourself the citation belongs inside the sentence that it is referencing.
    Example: Professors report that many students struggle with period placement when citing texts (11 Tips to Do Proper Citation for Your Research Paper, 2021).
    4. If Needed, Cite Yourself
    Self-plagiarism is an actual thing and you may be guilty of it without even knowing what it means. It may seem strange, but if you’re borrowing an idea from a previous paper you wrote, without appropriate citation, you’re plagiarising yourself.
    Say, you’ve been active in a research field for some time and your present work is an extension of previous studies. In such cases, you can reuse data from one of your previous papers. Just remember to cite yourself just as you would cite the work of others.
    5. Understand When to Cite Resources
    When writing an academic paper, you’re researching and presenting other people’s ideas to help discuss your own. You need to clearly show what idea belongs to whom.
    Whether you’re taking a direct quote, paraphrasing, or even referring to a general thought, you need to indicate the original source. It’s almost always better to over-reference than under-reference — otherwise, you risk plagiarizing.
    You don’t need to cite facts. World War I is widely accepted to have started in 1914, so you wouldn’t need to cite this — unless you found someone arguing differently, of course!
    6. Use an Online Citation Generator Tool
    An online citation generator helps you to produce fully-formatted citations after you enter information about your sources. If you find yourself struggling to remember different styles or are battling to make sense of a whole stack of sources, a citation tool can be a godsend.
    With these, you insert the source details into set fields, set your referencing style, and poof! A perfectly generated, error-free reference list will appear.
    7. Determine the Types of Sources
    In order to come up with a top-notch paper, chances are you will be looking at different kinds of sources: books, films, journal articles, etcetera.
    While determining the types of sources is easy if you’re handling them physically, many resources today are produced digitally and available online. This means you may be looking at a chapter of a book inside a PDF on a website — confusing!
    Always refer to a formal guide for your referencing style to help you decide.
    If you’re truly unsure, ask a librarian. They’ll often know the answer or where to find out.",
